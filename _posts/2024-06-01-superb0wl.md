## What’s Up, Tech Fam!

Yo! Let’s dive into something I cooked up back in 2020—**Superb0wl**. Imagine this: you're chilling, the Superbowl is blasting on every screen, and you  want to remotely shut off an infinate amount of the TVs at the same time. Enter the Superb0wl, my brainchild that transforms any ESP8266 into a mischievous WiFi-controlled IR blaster. Think less traditional remote, more ninja-style, room-hopping gadgetry that can play pranks or manage your electronic devices through WiFi signals.

## How It Works

This bad boy scans for specific WiFi networks and, once it finds its target, boom! It sends out IR signals that can turn devices on or off. What’s cooler? Each activated device will mimic the WiFi network’s name and start its own broadcast, creating a ripple effect. It’s like creating a mini botnet but for IR signals—perfect for some harmless chaos or just making your tech a bit smarter.

## Key Features You Gotta Check Out

### Web Interface
Control freaks, rejoice! You can tweak your IR signals from a slick web interface, no sweat. Customize to your heart’s content without fiddling with the actual hardware.

### WiFi Trigger
Set up your own triggers based on the WiFi networks around you. It's all automatic, so your devices know what to do and when to do it without you lifting a finger.

### Botnet Capability
Got a bunch of these set up around the house or office, local bar, or an entire street of bars? They can talk to each other and coordinate their mischief or helpful activities, extending your reach without extra effort.

## Why SuperbOwl Rocks

Born from a want to tune out the Superb0wl and give us techies some peace (or just to stir up some trouble), Superb0wl has grown into a toolkit for both pranking and practical solutions. Whether you want to secretly control the AV setup at your buddy’s party or automate your home environment, this project is your go-to.
