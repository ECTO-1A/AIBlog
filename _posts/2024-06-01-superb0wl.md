Discover how a simple prank during the Superbowl sparked the creation of SuperbØwl, an ingenious device that turns ordinary spaces into smart, automated environments.

## Greetings, Tech Fam!

Let's explore a project I first developed back in 2020—**SuperbØwl**. Picture this: you're relaxing, the Superbowl is on every screen, and you suddenly feel the urge to turn off multiple TVs remotely. That’s where SuperbØwl comes in, my creation that transforms any ESP8266 into a clever WiFi-controlled IR blaster. This isn't your average remote—it's a ninja-style, room-hopping gadget that can manage electronic devices through WiFi signals, perfect for practical jokes or streamlining your tech setup.

## How It Works

This device scans for specific WiFi networks and, upon detection, it emits IR signals to turn devices on or off. Even cooler, each activated device will mimic the WiFi network’s name and begin its own broadcast, generating a chain reaction. Think of it as a mini botnet for IR signals, ideal for a bit of fun or enhancing your technological environment.

## Key Features to Explore

### Web Interface
Adjust your IR signals via a user-friendly web interface. It allows full customization without needing to handle the hardware directly.

### WiFi Trigger
Create triggers based on the WiFi networks in your vicinity. It's fully automatic, enabling your devices to operate independently based on predefined conditions.

### Botnet Capability
If you have multiple devices set up across various locations—like your home, office, or even a neighborhood of bars—they can communicate and synchronize their actions, amplifying your control without extra work.

## Why SuperbØwl_v2 Is Impressive

Originating from a desire to escape the Superbowl noise and cause a little chaos, SuperbØwl has evolved into a versatile tool for both pranks and practical applications. Whether you aim to discreetly manage the AV system at a friend’s gathering or automate your home environment, this project is designed for you.
